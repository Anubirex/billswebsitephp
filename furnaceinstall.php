                    <h3>Step 1: Permit Coordination Call:</h3>
                    <p>The first call you&#39;ll receive will be from one of our
                        permit technicians. They&#39;ll assist you in scheduling a time for a state or county
                        inspector to review and approve the installation, ensuring everything complies
                        with local regulations and standards.</p>

                    <p>The second call, made by our dispatch team,
                        focuses on arranging the return visit of the original estimator. This call is not just
                        a routine check-in; it&#39;s an integral part of our commitment to your satisfaction.
                        We&#39;ll briefly discuss how the installation went and set up a time for a
                        comprehensive follow-up visit.</p>

                    <h3>Step 3: Quality Check and Return Visit:</h3>
                    <p>The return visit by the original estimator is a crucial step in our post-installation
                        service. During this visit, we perform a thorough quality check to ensure the
                        installation meets our high standards of craftsmanship. It&#39;s also the perfect time
                        for you to ask any remaining questions you may have about your new furnace.
                        This visit is more than a quality assurance check; it&#39;s an opportunity for us to
                        ensure that you are fully informed, comfortable, and confident in operating your
                        new heating system.</p>
