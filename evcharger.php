He gave me very competitive pricing, and their installer Sean and his crew were quick and efficient. Not to mention very friendly.",

And I can assure you, Bill's Heating & A/C does. Our previous 1990's era Carrier A/C & Furnace finally died so we put out the bids to get ours replaced. Bill's came in at the best price with a York Furnace & Heat Pump/AC. This was all installed back in May and so far everything has been running perfectly. During the summer, the Heat Pump/AC unit kept us very cool. One thing the wife really liked was how quiet it was. It's installed almost directly under our deck and you can barely hear it. So far the furnace has kept us nice and toasty this year. When it was installed, the crew was prompt, did a great job, and it was professionally installed. Really, if you need a new A/C or furnace system, you can't go wrong with these guys. Highly recommended.",

                    <h3>Step 1: Permit Coordination Call:</h3>
                    <p>The first call you&#39;ll receive will be from one of our
                        permit technicians. They&#39;ll assist you in scheduling a time for a state or county
                        inspector to review and approve the installation, ensuring everything complies
                        with local regulations and standards.</p>

                    <p>The second call, made by our dispatch team,
                        focuses on arranging the return visit of the original estimator. This call is not just
                        a routine check-in; it&#39;s an integral part of our commitment to your satisfaction.
                        We&#39;ll briefly discuss how the installation went and set up a time for a
                        comprehensive follow-up visit.</p>

                    <p>The return visit by the original estimator is a crucial step in our post-installation
                        service. During this visit, we perform a thorough quality check to ensure the
                        installation meets our high standards of craftsmanship. It&#39;s also the perfect time
                        for you to ask any remaining questions you may have about your new electric vehicle charger.
                        This visit is more than a quality assurance check; it&#39;s an opportunity for us to
                        ensure that you are fully informed, comfortable, and confident in operating your
                        new EV charger.</p>
