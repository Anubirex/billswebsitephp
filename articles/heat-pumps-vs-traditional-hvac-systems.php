            <h2 id="traditional-hvac-systems">Traditional HVAC Systems Explained</h2>
            <p>Traditional HVAC systems typically consist of separate units for heating and cooling, such as furnaces and air conditioners. These systems are well-established, providing reliable comfort throughout the year. They are designed to handle a wide range of temperatures and are often the go-to choice for homeowners in extreme climates.</p>
            <img src="../blogimages/furnace-guide-furnaces.webp" alt="Various types of furnaces and air handlers" width="1200" height="625">
            <h3>Components of Traditional Systems</h3>
            <div class="in-article-list">
                <ul class="in-article-list">
                    <li><span>Furnaces</span> &dash; Use gas, oil, or electricity to generate heat distributed through ducts.</li>
                    <li><span>Air Conditioners</span> &dash; Remove heat from indoor air and release it outside, cooling the home.</li>
                    <li><span>Boilers</span> &dash; Heat water to provide radiant heat through radiators or underfloor systems.</li>

            <h3>Heat Pump Efficiency</h3>
            <p>Heat pumps can achieve efficiencies of 300% or more, meaning they produce more energy than they consume in electricity. This is measured using the Heating Seasonal Performance Factor (HSPF) for heating and the Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio (SEER) for cooling. High-efficiency heat pumps have SEER ratings above 20 and HSPF ratings above 10.</p>
            <h3>Traditional System Efficiency</h3>
            <p>Modern furnaces and air conditioners have improved efficiency, with high-efficiency furnaces reaching up to 98% Annual Fuel Utilization Efficiency (AFUE). Air conditioners can have SEER ratings up to 26. However, since furnaces generate heat through combustion, they cannot match the efficiency levels of heat pumps in converting energy to heat.</p>
            <h3>Energy Savings</h3>
            <p>Switching to a heat pump can lead to significant energy savings over time, especially if you're replacing an older, less efficient system. Lower energy consumption not only reduces your utility bills but also lessens your environmental footprint.</p>
