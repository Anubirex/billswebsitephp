This landmark bill extended and modified many of the tax credits that were previously offered under the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 features tax credits for consumers and businesses that save money on energy bills, create jobs, make homes and buildings more energy efficient, utilize clean energy sources and lower greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change and global warming.</p>

It was the last government-owned uranium enrichment facility operating in the United States when work ceased in 2013.</p>

                        <p>IDAHO, USA — After finding a hole in her in furnace, Hope Wolf knew she needed to replace her unit. The current HVAC system puts her home at risk of a carbon monoxide leak, but this is a costly repair for the Payette homeowner. Wolf received multiple quotes for a new furnace. The quotes ranged between $8,900 and $9,600. One company told her if she was looking for a new unit a year ago, her quote may have been up to $3,000 cheaper.</p>

                        <p>The residence is a new home first occupied in November 2019. The original HVAC met the 2018 International Energy Code. The home was setup for two zones—downstairs and upstairs—with zone valves controlling which zone received airflow based on the call from the thermostats. The fixed capacity heating and cooling system maintained space temperature setpoints. The challenge of satisfying two dissimilar zones with single-capacity equipment resulted in issues with supply air temperatures in both heating and cooling.</p>

                        <p>The Idaho Division of Occupational and Professional Licenses put forth a recommendation to the Idaho Building Code Board earlier this summer to significantly pare down the state’s energy code regulations governing plumbing, HVAC, and electrical systems. Energy codes are building regulations governing a range of items in building construction related to energy efficiency, including insulation on hot water pipes, requirements for the sizing of heating and cooling systems, and tests measuring how well buildings keep inside air from going out. </p>
