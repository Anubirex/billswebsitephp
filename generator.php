And I can assure you, Bill's Heating & A/C does. Our previous 1990's era Carrier A/C & Furnace finally died so we put out the bids to get ours replaced. Bill's came in at the best price with a York Furnace & Heat Pump/AC. This was all installed back in May and so far everything has been running perfectly. During the summer, the Heat Pump/AC unit kept us very cool. One thing the wife really liked was how quiet it was. It's installed almost directly under our deck and you can barely hear it. So far the furnace has kept us nice and toasty this year. When it was installed, the crew was prompt, did a great job, and it was professionally installed. Really, if you need a new A/C or furnace system, you can't go wrong with these guys. Highly recommended.",
