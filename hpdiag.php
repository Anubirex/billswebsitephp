He gave me very competitive pricing, and their installer Sean and his crew were quick and efficient. Not to mention very friendly.",

And I can assure you, Bill's Heating & A/C does. Our previous 1990's era Carrier A/C & Furnace finally died so we put out the bids to get ours replaced. Bill's came in at the best price with a York Furnace & Heat Pump/AC. This was all installed back in May and so far everything has been running perfectly. During the summer, the Heat Pump/AC unit kept us very cool. One thing the wife really liked was how quiet it was. It's installed almost directly under our deck and you can barely hear it. So far the furnace has kept us nice and toasty this year. When it was installed, the crew was prompt, did a great job, and it was professionally installed. Really, if you need a new A/C or furnace system, you can't go wrong with these guys. Highly recommended.",

                    <p>Josh was the most professional technician we have ever had the pleasure to work with. 
                      He was fast in testing our 18 year old heat pump. Answered every question we had. 
                      He even provided an estimate for a new unit since our unit is fast approaching the end of its life cycle. 
                      I could not make a higher recommendation for Josh and Bill&apos;s heating. Thank you very much.</p>

                    <p>Josh was the most professional technician we have ever had the pleasure to work with. 
                      He was fast in testing our 18 year old heat pump. Answered every question we had. 
                      He even provided an estimate for a new unit since our unit is fast approaching the end of its life cycle. 
                      I could not make a higher recommendation for Josh and Bill&apos;s heating. Thank you very much.</p>                      </div>

                    <p>We called Bill&apos;s to come look at our heat pump that&apos;s having issues. 
                      Our technician Adam was extremely knowledgeable and friendly. 
                      He thoroughly walked me through the issues with current unit and explained the difference in the new technology. 
                      We could not be happy with the service we received from Adam and Bill&apos;s. 
                      They have already confirmed installation availability for tomorrow morning on the new system. Great customer service!</p>                      </div>
