                <h2 id="types-of-air-conditioners">Types of Air Conditioners</h2>
                <p>Understanding the different types of air conditioners is the first step in choosing the right system for your home. Each type has its advantages and is suited to specific situations and requirements.</p>
                <h3>Central Air Conditioning Systems</h3>
                <p>Central air conditioners are the most common type for whole-house cooling. They use a split system that includes an outdoor unit (compressor and condenser) and an indoor unit (evaporator coil) connected by refrigerant lines. Air is cooled and then distributed through a network of ducts and vents. Central systems are ideal for homes with existing ductwork and offer the benefit of consistent temperatures throughout the house.</p>
                <h3>Ductless Mini-Split Systems</h3>
                <p>Ductless mini-split systems consist of an outdoor compressor and one or more indoor air-handling units. They are connected by a conduit that houses the power cable, refrigerant tubing, and condensate drain. These systems are excellent for homes without ductwork, room additions, or areas where installing ductwork is impractical. They offer zoned cooling, allowing you to control temperatures in individual rooms.</p>
                <h3>Window Units</h3>
                <p>Window air conditioners are self-contained units installed in a window or through a hole in an exterior wall. They are suitable for cooling single rooms or small spaces and are relatively affordable and easy to install. However, they can obstruct views and may not be as energy-efficient as other options.</p>
                <h3>Portable Air Conditioners</h3>
                <p>Portable air conditioners are freestanding units that can be moved from room to room. They use a hose to vent hot air outside through a window or opening. While convenient, they are generally less efficient and effective than other types and are best used as temporary solutions.</p>
                <img src="images\equipment-header-800w.webp" alt="Various types of air conditioners displayed" width="800" height="450">
                <p>Choosing the right type depends on factors such as your home's layout, existing infrastructure, cooling needs, and budget.
