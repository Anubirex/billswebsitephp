                          <p>Josh was the most professional technician we have ever had the pleasure to work with. 
                            He was fast in testing our 18 year old heat pump. Answered every question we had. 
                            He even provided an estimate for a new unit since our unit is fast approaching the end of its life cycle. 
                            I could not make a higher recommendation for Josh and Bill&apos;s heating. Thank you very much.</p>

                            Our technician Adam was extremely knowledgeable and friendly. 
                            He thoroughly walked me through the issues with current unit and explained the difference in the new technology. 
                            We could not be happy with the service we received from Adam and Bill&apos;s. 
                            They have already confirmed installation availability for tomorrow morning on the new system. Great customer service!</p>

                            Matthew was able to give us an estimate for the replacement part and order it.
