                    <dt id="Z">Zone</dt>
                    <dd>In HVAC, a zone is an area or section of a building that has distinct heating and cooling needs, controlled independently from other areas. Zoning is used for improving comfort and energy efficiency.</dd>

                    <dt>Zoning System</dt>
                    <dd>An HVAC system that uses dampers in the ductwork to regulate and redirect air to specific areas or zones within a building. Each zone has its own thermostat and control mechanism.</dd>

                    <dt>Zero Energy Building</dt>
                    <dd>A building with zero net energy consumption, meaning the total amount of energy used annually is roughly equal to the amount of renewable energy created on-site. These buildings often use advanced HVAC systems to maximize energy efficiency.</dd>

                    <dt>Zeotropic Refrigerant</dt>
                    <dd>A blend of refrigerants that have different boiling points and evaporate or condense at different rates. This characteristic can affect the efficiency and operation of HVAC systems using these refrigerants.</dd>

                    <dt>Zone Valve</dt>
                    <dd>A valve used to control the flow of water or steam in a hydronic heating or cooling system. Each zone valve is typically controlled by its own thermostat.</dd>

                    <dt>Zigbee</dt>
                    <dd>A wireless communication standard used in some smart HVAC systems for controlling thermostats, sensors, and other components. It allows for remote and automated control of the HVAC system.</dd>

                    <dt>Zoned Control Panel</dt>
                    <dd>The central control unit in a zoned HVAC system that manages the opening and closing of dampers and coordinates the heating or cooling based on the settings of each zone&apos;s thermostat.</dd>

                    <dt>Zone Sensor</dt>
                    <dd>A sensor located within an HVAC zone that monitors temperature, humidity, or other environmental conditions, providing feedback to the system to maintain the desired conditions in that zone.</dd>
