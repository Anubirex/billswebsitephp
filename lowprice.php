He gave me very competitive pricing, and their installer Sean and his crew were quick and efficient. Not to mention very friendly.",

          "reviewBody": "I called two different HVAC companies regarding installation of a ductless mini-split in my newly built craft shed. Both were very responsive and answered the phone on my first call; however, one could not even quote me for three weeks, and Bill’s was able to quote me on the following day. Bill’s quote included submission of a rebate from Avista for me, instead of expecting me to call Avista and figure it out myself. I did have both companies quote me and the quote from Bill’s was about $1500 less ($1000 less without the rebate) and for what appeared to be comparable equipment (although of course I’m not a professional). The other company also told me, “there is probably a rebate from Avista, but you will have to call and ask them if you qualify.” A bit disappointing. When it came to scheduling, Bill’s was able to install as soon as the next day. The other company was a month out. Ultimately it was a pretty easy choice, simply due to price and scheduling availability. The other company I have worked with before, and their staff is responsive and courteous, but they must just be quite busy and I really wanted the project done quickly so I can start using my hobby shed! Regarding the staff I dealt with directly, I cannot recommend them highly enough. I was quoted by Isaac, who was on time, professional, and very nice to talk to. I spoke with the finance manager Jennifer on multiple occasions. She always picked up her phone promptly and was super helpful. Finally my unit was installed by Jonathan and Austin, and they were also very professional and they worked FAST. The work they did was still of great quality, and they installed the unit exactly as I had asked. Highly recommend Bill’s and will definitely call them in the future for HVAC needs.",

      <h1>Everyday Lowest Price Guarantee</h1>
      <p>
        We commit that we will offer the lowest price on the purchase and installation of new, qualifying equipment. If you receive a qualifying lower estimate, we&apos;ll not only match it &dash; we&apos;ll beat it! Exclusions apply.</p>
          <h2>How the Lowest Price Guarantee Works&colon;</h2>
          <p>Our commitment is to provide you with the lowest prices on the best equipment for your residence. We honor this commitment 365 days per year. 
          <br><br>
          If you receive an estimate for the purchase and installation of comparable qualifying equipment, we&apos;ll provide you with a lower estimate for the purchase and installation of like&dash;for&dash;like or comparable equipment. 
          <br><br>
          To qualify, you must provide us with a written estimate from a competitor that is less than 30 days old. Any competing estimates that you would like us to beat must be provided before the equipment is purchased and installed. In return, we will provide you with a lower estimate for the purchase and installation of equipment with similar or better specifications to meet the needs of your residence.
